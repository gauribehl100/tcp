TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) client-server communication consists of two important components. These two consist of a server and more than one client.
The servers receive incoming connections from clients on a specific port number using a ServerSocket.
The client then connects to the port using a Socket with the serverâ€™s IP address.
Once the connection is created, the data can be exchanged between the server and the client using input and output streams.
